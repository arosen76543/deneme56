**Superman** was built to make it easy to host [Discord Bot Maker](https://dbotmaker.io/) bots on [Glitch](https://glitch.com).

I used [this guide](https://dbotmaker.io/forums/threads/glitch-hosting-free-compatible-with-beta-saves-data.305/), but now all the files are publicly avaliable. I take ownership of updating the actions here often, but I still reccomend making sure the mods that **you** use are here. I am just using the public mod-pack, so if you use that, **you're good to go!**

# My guide:
This isn't updated frequently, I don't suggest going off of this without knowledge of what you are doing.

### Get all of your files ready.
In this case, all you need is your "data" folder. Navigate to the directory you installed your bot, and retrive those files. We'll need them later.
If you have a GitHub account, this is made ***really*** easy. Just login with GitHub in the top-right.

### 2. Create a new "hello-express" project.
**ProTip:** After you make your project, click the little drop-down and click the lock. This will keep your data private.

Paste `noahmarshall12/superman` in the box, then press Okay.

### 4. Paste in your "data" files.
I told you to keep these handy. Locate the "data" directory and paste in your files

### 5. Make sure your bot token is correct.
Most people breeze over this. Check "settings.json" and make sure you entered your bot token.

### 6. Wait for the bot to start.
It might still be installing node modules, this takes a minute, but after paintently waiting, your bot should appear online.

### 7. Let's make your bot stay online.
Don't get happy yet, your bot will go offline after 5 minutes. Not the reason your hosting on Glitch, right? To fix this, you can setup a "ping". This will have a robot open the project every 5 minutes to keep it online.

### 7.2. Create an UptimeRobot account
Visit [UptimeRobot's Sign Up page](https://uptimerobot.com/signUp) and make an account.

### 7.3. Create a ping.
This is what will keep your bot online. Click "Add New Monitor".

Now, go back to Glitch, and get your project URL.

You have finished! Your Discord Bot Maker bot will be hosted 24/7 in the cloud for free! That wasn't hard, right?
